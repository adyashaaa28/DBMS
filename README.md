## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DBMS.git
    cd DBMS
    ```
2. **Set up the environment:**
    - Ensure you have **Python 3** installed.
    - For Python/SQL scripts, install required packages (for SQLite):
      ```
      pip install sqlite3
      ```
    - For MySQL/Postgres/other, install the necessary Python connectors (`mysql-connector-python`, `psycopg2`, etc.).

3. **Run the scripts:**
    - For SQL queries:
      - Open `.sql` files in your DBMS tool (like MySQL Workbench, PostgreSQL, or SQLite).
      - Execute as needed.
    - For Python scripts:
      ```
      python scriptname.py
      ```
